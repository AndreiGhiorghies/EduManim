It breaks the text into small pieces called tokens, which can be whole words, word fragments, or even single characters, and turns each token into an integer. Then the model repeatedly asks one question: given everything it has seen so far, what is the probability of every possible next token? It samples one, appends it, and runs the whole process again.", 'visual_hint': "Start with a sentence such as '$\\\\text{The cat sat on the...}$' written in text.

Each token morphs into an integer ID above it. Draw a rightward arrow to a horizontal bar chart of probabilities over a small vocabulary. The bars grow to different heights; a token such as '$\\\\text{mat}$' is highlighted, an arrow appends it back to the sentence, and the chart resets to show the iterative loop.", 'key_concepts': ['Tokenization maps text to integer token IDs', 'Autoregressive next-token prediction', 'Sampling and appending the predicted token']}, {'id': 2, 'title': 'From Tokens to Vectors', 'narration': 'Raw integers, however, carry no semantic meaning. The model pulls each token ID through an embedding lookup table to produce a long vector in a high-dimensional space, where similar tokens cluster together and analogies often appear as simple vector offsets. Because this lookup alone erases word order, a positional encoding vector is added to every token to encode its place in the sequence. These combined vectors are then fed into a tall stack of transformer blocks, each reshaping them through attention and feed-forward layers.', 'visual_hint': "Show a table on the left with token IDs and a large matrix labeled $E$ on the right.
